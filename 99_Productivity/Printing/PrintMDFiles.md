# How to Print MarkDown Files

There is no built-in Print command in VS Code. If you want to print out MarkDown (MD) files, the workaround is to export your MD files as HTML, open them in your browser and print from the browser.

To do this, you need to install an extension. Here are two extensions that you might like to consider:

* PrintCode
* Markdown All in One

## PrintCode

You can use the [PrintCode](https://printcode.launchaco.com/) extension ([review](https://irishdotnet.dev/fridaydevtip-how-to-print-from-visual-studio-code)) to print any file as-is, in one step.

> :smiley: To print a file, press `F1` and type or select `PrintCode`. Your file will be converted to HTML and opened in the Chrome browser, with the Print dialog already open. Then you simply press the Print button.
>
> :slightly_smiling_face: You can print any kind of file (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ...), not just MarkDown
>
> :slightly_smiling_face: Code colouring and line numbering will be applied
>
> :neutral_face: This extension only handles printing
>
> :slightly_frowning_face: The printed file shows the original MD code, not nicely formatted text. In particular, images and emojis will not be shown.

## Markdown All in One

You can use the [Markdown All in One](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one) extension to format your files nicely, and export them as HTML. You can then open the output files manually in the appropriate application, and print them from there.

> :smiley: The files are nicely formatted, in the same way as what you will see in a Preview pane in VS Code or GitHub
>
> :slightly_smiling_face: The extension provides other useful features for creating and previewing MD files.
>
> :neutral_face: This extension only handles MarkDown
>
> :slightly_frowning_face: Printing is a multi-step process
