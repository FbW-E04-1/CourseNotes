## Play with Markdown in VS Code
GitHub uses a simple syntax for styling text: Markdown. You can read about it
[here](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

* With VS Code, create a file with the extension `.md` (E.g.: `sandbox.md`)
* In VS Code, with your MD file open in the editor, press the keys Ctrl-K and then press V. (You should see a second panel open named Preview <your_file_name>.md)
* Practice using the Markdown syntax in the left panel, and observe how it is styled in the right panel.
