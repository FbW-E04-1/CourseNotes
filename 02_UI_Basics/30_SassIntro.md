# SASS Intro

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sass_(stylesheet_language))
> **Sass** (short for ***syntactically awesome style sheets***) is a preprocessor scripting language that is interpreted or compiled into Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). SassScript is the scripting language itself.
>
> Sass consists of two syntaxes.
> * The original syntax, called "the indented syntax," uses a syntax similar to Haml.[2] It uses indentation to separate code blocks and newline characters to separate rules.
> * The newer syntax, **SCSS** (Sassy CSS), uses block formatting like that of CSS. It uses braces to denote code blocks and semicolons to separate rules within a block. The indented syntax and SCSS files are traditionally given the extensions .sass and .scss, respectively.
