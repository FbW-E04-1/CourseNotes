# Assignment
[Image Viewer Repository](https://classroom.github.com/a/ZbcBUSVS)

* Create a div with id "viewport"
* Inside it, create a div with the id "wrapper"
* Inside the `wrapper` div, add all the images from the `img` folder
* Add an `alt` attribute for each image
* In the `styles.css` file
  * Create a rule for the `#viewport` div, so that it shows its own scrollbar
  * Create a rule for the `#wrapper` div so that it is wide enough for all 9 images
  * Set a height for the `#wrapper` div, and a background color
  * Create a rule for the images, so that they scale to fit the height of the`#wrapper` div
  * Create a space between each image
  * Ensure that there is not a space after the last image

## Bonus

* Checkout the `final` branch and take a look at the `styles2.css` file. This uses CSSÂ variables, so that you can tweak all the settings in one place.
